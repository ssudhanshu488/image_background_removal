# image_background_removal
# Overview
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for removing backgrounds from images. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve precise and efficient background removal, making it suitable for various applications, including photo editing and e-commerce.

# DataSet
The dataset used in this project consists of images with their corresponding masks. Each image has a manually labeled mask that delineates the foreground from the background. This dataset can be collected from various sources or generated manually using photo editing tools.

•Number of Instances: Variable (depending on the dataset used)<br />
•Number of Attributes: Image data and corresponding masks<br />
•Attribute Information:<br />
&ensp;  •Images (RGB or grayscale)<br />
&ensp;  •Masks (binary images with foreground and background)
